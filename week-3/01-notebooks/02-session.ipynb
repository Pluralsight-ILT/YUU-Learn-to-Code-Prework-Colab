    "Today, we learned how to use while loops to repeat actions as long as a condition is true. We saw examples using a counter, iterating over a list, and even cases where the loop does not run because the condition is false. We also practiced several exercises, including computing the sum, average, and product of a list of numbers. Remember to always update your loop variable to avoid infinite loops. Great work today!"
