    "# Session 2: Variables and Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to dig deeper into the process of programming, or coding. We're going to learn about _conditionals_, which is the way we make our code act based on a condition or predicate. We can change the outcome based on the state of a program, and have different outcomes for different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agenda\n",
    "1. **Review of Previous Session/Homework** (15 minutes): Be sure we all understand what was covered in the last session before moving forward\n",
    "2. **Variables** (15 minutes): We will learn what a variable is, how to name them, and how to use them\n",
    "3. **Boolean variables/Boolean expressions** (10-15 minutes): We will learn about expressions and variables which are not numbers or strings, but rather, True or False\n",
    "4. **Conditional/\"if\" Statements** (45 minutes): We will learn how to ask yes/no questions in our code, and run different code based on the answers we get"
